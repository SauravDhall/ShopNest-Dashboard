# ShopNest-Dashboard
Situation: ShopNest lacked a centralized reporting solution to monitor sales, revenue, profit, and order performance, limiting visibility into trends, regional gaps, and category-level insights for business stakeholders.

Task: Architect and develop a scalable, interactive Power BI dashboard that consolidates multi-dimensional sales data and enables stakeholders to track KPIs, analyze trends, and make data-driven decisions efficiently.

Action: Designed and implemented an end-to-end Power BI solution by integrating multi-source sales data, creating advanced DAX measures for key KPIs (Sales, Profit, Orders, AOV), optimizing data models for performance, and delivering interactive visuals with slicers, drill-throughs, and regional analysis.

Result: Enabled real-time, self-service analytics that improved stakeholder decision-making, reduced manual reporting effort, increased reporting efficiency, and provided clear visibility into sales performance across regions, states, and product categories.
